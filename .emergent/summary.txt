The previous AI engineer successfully initiated a Tarot mobile app project, progressing from initial setup to a fully functional, navigable application with robust multi-language support. Key phases included establishing the Expo, FastAPI, MongoDB stack, implementing core navigation, and extensive debugging of frontend rendering issues. A significant portion of the work focused on integrating Turkish language support across the UI and backend data, followed by fixing interpretation logic. The engineer also addressed critical UX by adding back to home buttons on all secondary screens. The current work involves integrating user-provided card images into the backend, a process that was ongoing when the trajectory ended, with a noted backend data duplication issue still needing resolution.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a professional Expo mobile app replicating the functionality of the Tarot - Apps on Google Play reference. The app should offer five main reading types (Card of the Day, Classic Tarot, Path of the Day, Yes or No, Couples Tarot), a Tarot Quiz Game with 198 questions across three difficulty levels, and detailed Card Meanings for all 22 Major Arcana. The application must feature beautiful card flip animations, a dark mystical theme, sound effects, and haptic feedback for a delightful user experience. Critical UI/UX principles like thumb-friendliness, gesture-driven interfaces, and accessibility are paramount. All features must be cross-platform compatible.

The development has delivered:
- A functional Expo React Native frontend and FastAPI backend with MongoDB.
- Core navigation structure, enabling users to move between the homepage, reading types, card meanings, and quiz sections.
- Comprehensive Turkish language support for all frontend UI elements and initial tarot card data (names, keywords, meanings, descriptions, symbolism, yes/no).
- Back to Home buttons implemented across all navigated pages for improved user experience.
- Backend API endpoints for fetching cards, generating readings, and supporting multi-language content.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React Native/Expo frontend and a FastAPI/MongoDB backend.

**Directory Structure:**


-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, handling API routes, data retrieval from MongoDB, and business logic. It stores the  data with both English and Turkish translations.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial setup with basic CRUD for tarot cards.
        -    array was populated with 22 cards, each having , , , , , ,  in English.
        -   Extended with Turkish counterparts: , , , , , ,  for all 22 cards.
        -   API endpoints (, , ) were updated to accept a  query parameter and return data in the requested language.
        -   The  function was modified to correctly fetch language-specific meanings () with a fallback.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: The main homepage of the application, presenting different tarot reading options and other features.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initial scaffold for reading type buttons and quiz/card meanings buttons.
        -   Integration of  for navigation, replacing  alert functions with .
        -   Implemented internationalization (i18n) with  for language and a language toggle button (EN/TR). All static texts were updated to display based on the selected language.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Defines the root layout and navigation stack for the entire application using Expo Router.
    -   **Changes Made**: Simplified to correctly render children after initial troubleshooting of navigation context issues.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Dynamic screen for various tarot reading types.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Integrated i18n for all UI texts, including reading descriptions, button labels (Falı Başlat, Yeni Fal), and error messages.
        -   Added language toggle button.
        -   Implemented a Back to Home button for seamless navigation.
        -   Updated API calls to the backend to include the  parameter when requesting card interpretations.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays a list of Major Arcana cards.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Integrated i18n for the page title (Major Arcana / Büyük Arkana) and loading messages.
        -   Added language toggle button.
        -   Implemented a Back to Home button.
        -   Updated  to refetch card data in the selected language when the language state changes.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Displays detailed information about a specific tarot card.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Integrated i18n for card details (name, keywords, meanings, descriptions, symbolism, yes/no).
        -   Added language toggle button.
        -   Added a Back to Home button.
        -   Updated  to fetch card details in the selected language.
-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Provides the quiz game interface with different difficulty levels.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Integrated i18n for titles, difficulty levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced), question counts, and learning tips.
        -   Added language toggle button.
        -   Implemented a Back to Home button and ensured  is imported.

<pending_tasks>
- Resolve the backend  array duplication issue.
- Fully integrate the uploaded tarot card images into  (base64 format).
- Ensure frontend displays card names in Turkish when the language is set to Turkish.
- Implement Phase 5: Visual Polish & Effects from the initial plan (card flip animations, sound effects, haptic feedback).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was in the process of integrating user-provided tarot card images into the application. The user uploaded two batches of 5 images, and the AI successfully identified the cards corresponding to these images (e.g., The Lovers, The Hanged Man, Justice, The Chariot, The Moon, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Magician, The Fool). The next step was to update the backend's  data with these images, presumably in base64 format as per the system instructions. This task is part of enhancing the visual fidelity of the application, which currently uses placeholder image URLs. There's also an unresolved issue of 38 cards instead of 22 in the backend's  array, indicating data duplication that needs to be addressed for accurate card fetching and display.
